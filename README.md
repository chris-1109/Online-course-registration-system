1.	AIM:
  The Software design document would demonstrate how the design will accomplish the functional and non- functional requirements captured      in the Software Requirement specification (SRS). The document will provide a framework to the programmers through describing the high-    level components and architecture, sub systems, interfaces, database design and algorithm design. This is achieved through the use of      architectural patterns, design patterns, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, relational models and user interfaces.

2.	OBJECTIVE:
   This software design specification is made with the purpose of outlining the software architecture and design of the Student                Registration System in detail. The document will provide developers an insight in meeting clientâ€™s needs efficiently and effectively.      Moreover, the document facilitates communication and understanding of the system by providing several views of the system design. The      system provides a real-time, complete platform for online course enrollment at a University. There are two types of users for this         system admin and students. Based on their user role stored in the database, users can access their respective resources.
